              Hi. I'm minseo. You can call me gemma instead of it as well. I was born and raised in Seoul
              , South Korea. I'm currently working in Starbucks as a barista for last one year. I have a lot of 
              colleagues who is sincere and warm-hearting. Thanks to them, I can get wider eyes to look at a world and 
              also gained many useful skills. I also acquired communication skills with people who has diverse culture 
              backgrounds and speaks different languages. Most importantly, I learned how important treating people
              on <b>my heart and soul in communication person to person</b>.

              I majored in business management in Korea and took a lecture called ‘management information technology’ by chance. 
              That was a chance encounter with IT. Compared with other engineering lectures, basically it’s not practical 
              but it was a lecture to generally learn information technology how enterprises appropriately utilize to manage. 
              It made me change my thought about IT and feel more friendly. In end of it, a professor recommended a website 
              called <b>Udemy</b> to learn something new in various fields. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I came here through a youth mobility scheme of UK after graduation to <b>discover what I want to do in my life</b>. 
              I’ve been spending few months thinking of how I should spend 2 years in the UK. I would like to spend preciously 
              and wouldn’t like to regret wasting of it. Life is so long as much as we can do a challenge we've never done, 
              even though we would fail and finally collapse. According to my experiences, trying something new has always changed me and my life. 
              I’ve always wanted to learn something new and <b>long term skill</b> in life and decided to learn it I’ve never tried.
              I've reminded what my professor recommended before in the lecture. And I begun to take classes of programming 
              from Udemy.

              I have been learning myself since July 2019 and I have a dream to be a front-end developer in London. 
              To make my dream come true, Founders and Coders is the best place not only I can boost programming skills and increase
              the ability but also can be surrounded by people who have <b>similar object and interests</b> about coding.
              I'd love to be together to learn programing and build diverse and unique projects I've never tried.  
            </p> 
            <p>
              But this is not just only for learning skills of it. Before entering in real world of web development, 
              I’d like to exert teamwork all together with team members and get experiences making some projects. 
              I like sharing my knowledge and helping people. <b>I'd love to contribute my skills to the others to
              encourage them, give and get more motivation.</b>

              <p>I’m get ready to spread <b>my passion positivity and motivation</b> of learning programming. 
                I had used to doubt that this way of being a web developer is truly correct so far during learning 
                it myself. But I was surprised that I'm so glad while I was building this personal website. And I decided to 
                keep learning and will become a developer, even though I couldn't get an opportunity to join in Founders and 
                Coders. I'm passionate and motivated of programming as much as I would think like that now. And my passion of 
                coding <b>will never go down:)</b>
              </p>

              <p>People generally don’t prefer showing others their weakness to their strength. I’m not afraid of revealing my 
                pros and cons to learn something new and solve difficulties on the projects with others. I’m sure I can be 
                <b>a teacher and student as a good supporter</b> at the same time. Because we’ll be in founders and coders to learn 
                programming all together not alone.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm good at organizing tasks and teamwork together. Moreover, I'm punctual to meet to the deadline.
                While I was a student, I've been piling many experiences up like student newspaper reporter and part time worker in 
                convenient stores, a bakery and so on. That was very small thing but I don't think they are useless in my life.
                Those little experiences brought together to make me <b>who I am</b> now.
